DESCRIPTION: What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka in high demand and high paying) for Business & Data Analysts jobs in Switzerland or Germany?
Steps:
    1. Identify the skills in high-demand and associated with high-paying jobs for our roles
    2. Focus on roles in our geographies of choice that have salary information.
-Â» Use CTE to come up with the results (just for fun - it can be more effectively by doing a couple of joins)
